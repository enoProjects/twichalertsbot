# Twitch Alerts Bot
Here is yet another Twich bot/Twitch alerts bot for you. This time using J2CL and Wildfly Bootable jar.

Why make this? Just as a learning excercise for J2CL, Bootable jar and Twitch API. Currently hard coded for my needs, but maybe one day there is a way to customize it for your needs.

I work on this in my stream. Adding features time to time what I need them:
